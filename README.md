# FCM166

Welcome to my code repository for ***Full Circle Magazine*** issue 166.

Here you will find the code for my How-To Python article # 114 for February 2020 that appears (you might be able to tell) in ***Full Circle Magazine*** issue 166.



The Python code for this month is an updated version of my article in FCM issue 104 way back in 2015 showing how to use Python to control the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi.  This time, we are using a new (to me at least) board that allows you to do GPIO programming using a regular Linux, Windows or Mac machine.
